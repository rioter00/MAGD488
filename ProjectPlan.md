Collaborative projects must address a collaboration tool for communication: [Trello](http://trello), GChat, [Asana](http://asana.com), [Slack](http://slack.com), [Facebook](http://messenger.com). **The instructor must be included in this tool.**

Collaborative projects may follow any collaborative project methodology.

Projects may run concurrently or consecutively.

You will bring this project plan in each week along with the project materials and [weekly writeup](WeeklyWriteup.md).
