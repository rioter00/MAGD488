## Procedure
1. Brainstorm project that will expand your portfolio.
These projects may be created individually or as a group.
You will plan your project and discuss with Dr. Hwang your project's scope, quality, pertinence/relevant. Your group may be asked to change, amend, adjust aspects of your project and/or plan. If your group's progress slow, decides to go in another direction, change ideas, your group may be asked to **remake** a weekly plan to reflect the new strategy.
2. Each project plan must
	+	Be Digitally produced (Microsoft Word, Google Docs)
	+ Address stages of _weekly_ progress, for each individual, in a weekly schedule, including the follow aspects.
		1. 'first prototype'
		2. 'peer review' presentation - **April 4 or April 11**
		3. 'revision'
		4. 'final'


Plans for collaborative projects must address each collaborator's weekly check point. Each week, for each individual, should plan progress.

Collaborative projects may follow any collaborative project methodology.

Your entire group will be graded on the completion of this assignment as a whole; if this plan is incomplete, the group will receive the same grade. Your weekly writeups will be completely individually.
