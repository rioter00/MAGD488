## Course Description
The goal of this class is to learn effective digital project management and deliver a completed project to professional standards. Students will take a Beta stage project developed in MAGD 487 to completion, or begin a new project (with permission of the instructor). Projects will be developed according to current industry practice using project specification, schedules with milestones, online project management tools, user experience testing and version control. Marketing and commercial development will be explored and students will be encouraged to transition final projects to the commercial environment where appropriate.

## Course Objectives
At the end of the course students will have:
- Having designed and implemented an online portfolio, students will have created one to two major projects that will contribute to their body of work
- Positioned themselves within the relevant field(s)/market(s) for career opportunities
- Identify areas where you need to improve your skills, develop a strategy for doing so, and follow through with one set of skills
- Learn and practice effective digital project management
- Develop projects that integrate multiple technologies, software and effective design
- Identify, evaluate and work with appropriate software and techniques to successfully realize their project designs       
- Conduct and analyze user experience tests, and implement appropriate project changes
- Deliver projects to professional standards
- Create/maintain an appropriate professional portfolio and web presence
- Be aware of design trends, best practices, and concerns in the relevant field
- Gained experience presenting own material
- Become more comfortable giving and receiving peer review

### Attendance & Student Expectations
Your presence in class is expected with excused absences being medical and family emergencies (such as a death in the family). You may have two unexcused absences without penalty, but beyond that you will lose 1/3 of a letter grade (A → A- → B+ → B → B- → C+, etc) from your final grade for each unexcused absence.

Please don't ask me what you missed. It is your responsibility to check D2L, talk to other students, get notes, check announcements, etc.

Practice respect and empathy with others during discussions and activities.

Read/view/review any assigned media before class.

Assignments are due by the start of class unless specified. Projects may have different timeline and will be stated when project is assigned.

Late assignments are not accepted for full grading consideration, with two exceptions:
 1. 	If you’ve talked with me at least one day before the assignment is due and obtained consent to hand it in at a later date.
 2. 	If you have a medical or family emergency for which you can provide some evidence of having to miss class to attend to.

If neither of these requirements is satisfied, you may still turn in a late assignment. It’s grade potential decreases by 10% each day it is late. (e.g. 24 hours late or less - 90% maximum grade; 48 hours late or less - 80% max grade; etc)

Keep digital copies of all of your work for this class. This is for both your sake and mine. If I happen to misplace your work, it is up to you to supply me with a new copy of it. Short version: Backup your digital work, scan or photograph your handwritten work.


### How I Will Communicate With You
Email & D2L: Check it! You are responsible for checking the course D2L website for announcements on a daily basis.

### Media Caveat
This is a media-heavy class, and as such we will be using computers for a large portion of the assignments. However, during lecture, discussion, or student presentations you may not have laptops, smart phones or mobile phones in use.

### Academic Misconduct
Multimedia fluency and competence make it much easier to engage in academic misconduct. These technologies also provide professors with more sophisticated techniques for detecting misconduct. UWS policy in regard to misconduct is available online (http://www.uww.edu/handbook/student/#14).

All work that you turn in should be your own. This includes text, images, audio and information. When you use work that is the intellectual property of others, this material should be properly identified and cited using either MLA or APA style citations. If you neglect to do this, you will automatically fail the assignment. If you willfully plagiarize the work of others, you will fail the course.

## UWW Statement

It is your responsibility to keep track of your grades over the course of the semester. Your grades are posted on D2L and can be checked at any time. You earn your grades by the degree to which you meet the requirements of the assignments. If you find that you are not doing as well as you would like to be doing, you can meet with me to discuss extra credit projects BEFORE the end of the semester. If you feel that I have made a mistake recording a grade that you earned, I encourage you to email me, politely, so that it can be corrected.
