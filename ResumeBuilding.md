## Definition
> A resume is an evolving document that summarizes your qualifications for employment. It lets the reader know the type of position you seek, and highlights your education, experience, skills, and other related information. Ultimately, the goal of your resume is to generate a job interview.

1. "Evolving document" - you should constantly update your resume whenever relevant information changes.
2. The end goal is a job interview.
3. Consider your resume as a marketing tool for yourself. You want to lead with the best relevant material.

### Getting Started - Gather your information
Creating a resume is no small task because of the amount of relevant information. If you've never created one, below is a checklist to help you gather your information. Remember that your resume should be job-specific, so though you may not have to completely redo your resume for each job, plan to make adjustments for each opening. Keeping a 'master' resume, from which you can pare down, with all your information will save you time each time you tailor for a new posting. 

#### General Information
  - Name
  - Address
  - Email
  - Phone Number
  - Education (School, Major, Minor, GPA, timespan/graduation date)
  - Honors, Awards
  - Organizations
  - Activities

#### Job Specific
  - Related Experience *
  - Related Skills, Qualifications, Proficiencies

#### Other - Not all resumes
  - Other Experience(s)
  - Summary / Tag-line
  - Objective

#### Your experience
When you write about your experience, use statements of accomplishment rather than just descriptions of role. Use action verbs when highlighting your experience. Be consistent with tense usage.  (http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/opia/job-search-toolkit/action-verbs/)

*Examples:*
- Directed effects team in X-Award-winning *Extreme Spawn Campers*.
- Created animated cutscenes for MTV series *Betty & Bubkus*.
- Implemented cross-platform multiplayer servers for *Jupiter Horizon: Eventual Defeat*

Include the job title, company, and time held by title.

Use active voice when highlighting experience.
*If you can add 'by zombies' at the end of a sentence, you are using passive voice.*


\* Some sources suggest using two sections 'Accomplishments' and 'Employment History', where the former highlights notable achievements (usually near the top of the resume).

### Tailoring your resume
Your resume should be job-specific. If you are applying for a 2D background artist position, your private detective experience may be superfluous. Whether you choose to include elements (2D art vs private detective experience) should depend on the job requirements.

#### Order
Now that you have the basic elements gathered, consider the ordering of elements.

A general rule to follow is to have the most relevant information closer to the top of your resume.

Consider leading with relevant professional (or intern) experience if you have it. If you recently graduated or are still in school, your most qualifying elements for the job may be your education.

#### Style
Use common typefaces and keep font sizes around 10 and 12 points. Differing typefaces for headers and paragraphs may aid readability. *Example: Courier for headers, Times for paragraphs.*

Be consistent with styles. *Example: All section headers are Courier, size 12, all caps, underlined. *

#### Tips

- Proofread. Check your spelling and grammar.

- Have someone else to look at your resume.

- Do not use abbreviations. Don't assume your reader will recognize acronyms or abbreviations.

- Be concise. Be honest.

- Use bullet points to stay organized. Larger sections usually don't have bullets.

- Most resumes are one pages.

- Print your resumes on white or slightly off-white color paper.

- Your attention to details will be evident to readers. Your lack of due diligence could be viewed in a poor light.

- If you are in college, your high school experiences and GPA are unnecessary.
